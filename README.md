FLHTOOLS - Field-Line Helicity TOOLS

A.R. Yeates, Durham University -- 20/7/18

===================================================

Python code (2.7 or 3.x) for computing vector potentials, field-line helicity, and helicity on a regular Cartesian grid. Also requires Fortran 90 (used for tracing field lines).

To start, you should read the manual (doc/man.pdf), which includes a quick-start guide to running the code.

The code accompanies a paper currently in preparation.
