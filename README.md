FLHTOOLS - Field-Line Helicity TOOLS

A.R. Yeates, Durham University -- 20/7/18

===================================================

Python code (2.7 or 3.x) for computing vector potentials, field-line helicity, and helic
ity on a regular Cartesian grid.

To start, you should read the manual (doc/man.pdf), which includes a quick-start guide t
o running the code.

The code accompanies a paper currently in preparation.
